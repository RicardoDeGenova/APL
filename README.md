# APL - Hospital Management System (HMS)

Medical management system for [Ann Prepare Lavni (APL)](https://annpreparelavni.org) 

This will be a software developed especifically for APL's mission trips and clinics, and its current needs. It will not be a general hospital/clinic management system.

Frameworks: Angular with ASP.NET Core

Constraints:
  - The software cannot rely on internet, they can sometimes stay days with no internet or with extremely low speeds;
  - It must be very sturdy and reliable, with a lot of redundancy, there is no option of remote updates (except on rare cases) as of now;
  - Since the users won't be very technical, it must be easy to maintain with almost no technical background.

The current idea/goal is to have the system running locally in a raspberry pi, with a local DB. Since internet is not reliable locally, the software will schedule to check internet access frequently and always try to send the current local data to the cloud, to have an independent copy online.

Functionality (must-haves):
  - Must print patient forms with fields ready to also be handwritten after printed
  - Iternationalization (English, Haitian Kreyol and Spanish, currently)
      - Language selection after sign-in (if the account logged-in doesn't already have one selected)
  - One user starts the patient records and another one can finish it (separate the proccess into several parts)

Users:
  - Doctor
  - Nurse
  - Check-in

Config:
  - Use SQLite for local config

### Current Triage Patient Form design idea (UI independent for now)

## Build

Run `dotnet build -tl` to build the solution.

## Run

To run the web application:

```bash
cd .\src\Web\
dotnet watch run
```

Navigate to https://localhost:5001. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Styles & Formatting

The template includes [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) support to help maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The **.editorconfig** file defines the coding styles applicable to this solution.

## Code Scaffolding

The template includes support to scaffold new commands and queries.

Start in the `.\src\Application\` folder.

Create a new command:

```
dotnet new ca-usecase --name CreateTodoList --feature-name TodoLists --usecase-type command --return-type int
```

Create a new query:

```
dotnet new ca-usecase -n GetTodos -fn TodoLists -ut query -rt TodosVm
```

If you encounter the error *"No templates or subcommands found matching: 'ca-usecase'."*, install the template and try again:

```bash
dotnet new install Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template::8.0.5
```

## Test

The solution contains unit, integration, functional, and acceptance tests.

To run the unit, integration, and functional tests (excluding acceptance tests):
```bash
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~AcceptanceTests"
```

To run the acceptance tests, first start the application:

```bash
cd .\src\Web\
dotnet run
```

Then, in a new console, run the tests:
```bash
cd .\src\Web\
dotnet test
```
